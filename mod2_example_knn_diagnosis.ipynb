    "\n",
    "As a junior data scientist at MediTech Solutions, you've joined a team developing a diagnostic support tool for primary care physicians. Your specific task is to build a k-NN model that helps doctors identify similar patient cases from historical records. The choice of distance metric is crucial, as it will determine how \"similarity\" between patients is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Dataset and the Challenge #####\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains patient records with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vital signs (continuous): blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc.\n",
    "- Lab results (continuous): cholesterol levels, blood glucose, etc.\n",
    "- Symptoms (binary): presence/absence of 20 different symptoms\n",
    "- Patient demographics (mixed): age (continuous), gender (binary), ethnicity (categorical)\n",
    "- Medical history (ordinal): severity levels of various conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is particularly complex because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature importance varies significantly (some vitals are more critical than others).\n",
    "- Features have different scales and units.\n",
    "- Features are highly correlated (especially among lab results).\n",
    "- The dataset contains mixed data types."
