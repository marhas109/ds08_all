    "\n",
    "As a junior data scientist at TeleConnect, a telecommunications company, you've been tasked with developing a model to predict which customers are likely to cancel their service (churn) in the next month. Your manager believes that identifying at-risk customers early could allow the retention team to take proactive measures and reduce overall churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEO has highlighted that acquiring a new customer costs five times more than retaining an existing one, making this project a high priority. You decide to implement a k-NN model because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's intuitive to explain to stakeholders.\n",
    "- The company has labeled historical data on which customers churned.\n",
    "- You need to predict a binary outcome (churn or no churn).\n",
    "- The transparent nature of k-NN allows the retention team to see which existing customers are most similar to potential churners.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dataset Details #####\n",
    "\n",
    "You're provided with a dataset containing information on 5,000 customers from the past year, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly bill amount\n",
    "- Contract length (in months)\n",
    "- Total service calls in the last 3 months\n",
    "- Service issues reported in the last 3 months\n",
    "- Total products/services subscribed\n",
    "- Months as a customer\n",
    "- Average monthly usage (in GB)\n",
    "- Churn status (Yes/No)"
